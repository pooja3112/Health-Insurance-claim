“Finding out the health parameters that affect health insurance claims”
# Problem Statement (Situation):
An insurance company in the US is reviewing its insurance claims/charges and is trying to do a cause
and effect analysis for future business decisions. It has collected data for its customers who have
made claims till recent time. The data-points collected are age, gender, bmi, number of
children/dependents, smoking habit, region they belong to, charges/bills claimed under the
insurance. This analysis would have a bearing on what premium should the company charge a
customer availing an insurance policy.
